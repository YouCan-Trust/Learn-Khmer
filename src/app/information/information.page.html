      <span style="font-family: HelveticaNeue-CondensedBold; color: Darkorange; font-size: 16px;font-weight: bolder;">Greetings</span>
      <hr>
      <p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0px;text-align : justify;">
        <strong>Greetings in Cambodia</strong> are more than just a way of saying "Hi". Known as "
        <strong>Sompeah</strong>", it involves holding your hands together as if praying and slightly bowing the head at the same
        time.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0px;text-align : justify;">The
        <strong>"Sompeah"</strong> is appropriate for both sexes. The height at which the hands are held depends on the social status
        of the person being greeted. With equal social standing, the hands are held near the mouth.
        <br>
        <br>When greeting someone of
        <strong>higher social status or a monk</strong>, for instance, the hands are held higher, signifying greater respect, and
        can be at the level of the nose or even the brow. The bow will also be correspondingly lower.
        <br>
        <br> When greeting someone younger or of inferior social status, the hands are held at the level of the chin.
        <br>
        <br> It is not necessary to "
        <strong>Sompeah</strong>" taxi drivers or waiters in a restaurant or other workers in shops, etc.
        <br>
        <br> After the initial introduction when you "
        <strong>Sompeah</strong>", it is not necessary to repeat it each time you meet afterwards, especially with friends or colleagues
        at work.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0px;text-align : justify;">However you greet, you should not forget to
        <strong style="color: orange;">smile -:))</strong>.</p>
      <br>

      <span style="font-family: HelveticaNeue-CondensedBold; color: Darkorange; font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;">Communication Style</span>
      <hr>
      <p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0px;text-align : justify;">To the uninitiated, communicating verbally in Cambodia can be confusing and sometimes even frustrating. This is due
        to the typical
        <strong>non-confrontational and indirect approach</strong> that distinguishes the Cambodian communications style.
        <br>
        <br> They will tell you what they think you want to hear rather than telling you the
        <strong>"truth"</strong>. This often results in getting contradictory information to the same question from different sources.
        <br>
        <br> As always,
        <strong>stay calm</strong> in such situations and do not aggravate them by pointing out the obvious.
        <br>
        <br> Their motivation is not malicious and they do not intend to cause you harm; rather, they aim to be polite and do
        not wish to bother you with their problems. The easiest way to ask questions then is to ask those that have a simple
        yes/no answer and to try and piece together the information thus gleaned into a bigger picture.
        <strong>Avoid the how/why questions</strong> that can cause discomfort and even irritability.

        <br>
        <br> In the event of a conflict, do not try to resolve the situation directly with the other party concerned. Rather,
        <strong>use a third party</strong>, an intermediary trusted by both sides, to resolve the conflict. The conflict itself may
        never get mentioned. The aim is to re-establish congenial relations and once this has been achieved, it is better
        not to bring up the contentious issue again.
        <br>
        <br>


        <strong>The world is not as black or white for Cambodians </strong>as it is for many Westerners and therefore "yes" may not
        always mean "yes" and "no" can also have different meanings, even "yes". Therefore, a clue to the correct interpretation
        is often found when observing the body language rather than the actual words. While Cambodians always smile, their
        smile can mean either pleasure or embarrassment, so other non-verbal communications, such as giggling nervously,
        especially when bringing negative news, will assist in understanding the real message that is being communicated.

      <span style="font-family: HelveticaNeue-CondensedBold; color: Darkorange; font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;">Making Eye Contact in Cambodia</span>
      <hr>
      <p>Unlike in the West, Cambodians tend to make indirect eye contact only in most social situations. When talking to a
        superior, like a manager for instance, direct eye contact is usually avoided. The same applies when speaking to an
        older person. However, you can follow their lead and if they look directly at you, it is fine to reciprocate but
        not to initiate. Conversely, when you are talking to a younger person or one of equal social standing, they will
        follow your lead as far as eye contact is concerned. It is common that when a man is talking to a woman, especially
        a much younger woman than the man, that the woman will tend to look at the ground and not at the person speaking.
      </p>

      <span style="font-family: HelveticaNeue-CondensedBold; color: Darkorange; font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;">Touch and Personal Space in Cambodia</span>
      <hr>
      <p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0px;text-align : justify;">
        <strong>It is recommended</strong> in a formal or business setting to always keep at arm's length from the next person, whether
        male or female.
        <br>
        <br> Physical contact between men and women should be avoided.
        <br>
        <br> In a social setting, follow what the others do but keeping an arm's length distance is always safe. If you are meeting
        with close friends of the same sex, physical contact, including hugging and holding hands, is acceptable and there
        are no sexual connotations associated with such behaviour.
        <br>
        <br> However, when meeting with people of the opposite sex, one should always be careful and remain at a safe distance.
        physical contact, especially in public places, is deemed to be inappropriate and any displays of affection in public
        should be avoided.
